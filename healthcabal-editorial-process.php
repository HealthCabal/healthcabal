            <p>With billions of web pages offering information on any topic imaginable, a simple online
                search for “itching on the hand” would return thousands of results in an instant.
                Some of these would either leave you confused or scared. Medical information is of a delicate nature,
                and therefore should be presented in an easy-to-understand manner. For medical information to serve its
                purpose, it has to be created and vetted by experts in the field.

                and health information is clearly explained and that our work reflects the latest medical research,
                and is presented accurately.</p>

            <h4>Subject-Matter Experts</h2>
                <p>

                    As we fly through the space of time, changes occur. Medical practices and standards change too.
                    Obsolete medical information could be as dangerous as not being informed at all, or even worse.
                    Therefore, our Medical Review Board routinely evaluates our content to ensure that it contains
                    the latest information, statistics and guidelines.
                    Whenever necessary, our content is re-written, re-edited and re-certified by our Review Board.
                    If you stumble upon any of our content that you think needs to be updated, please let us know by sending
                    an email to editorial[at]healthcabal.com.

                <h4>The Healthcabal Voice</h4>
                <p>Health information presented online is sometimes impersonal, cold, overwhelming and difficult
                    to clearly understand. To really serve our purpose of really educating our readers,
                    we have adopted a voice that speaks to the heart of our readers in a manner that subtly asserts authority,
                    yet remaining compassionate and reassuring them that we truly care about them.
                </p>
